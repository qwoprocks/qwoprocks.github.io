# October 2022: Meta Global Hackathon

## 1st Place

The hackathon took place over 2 weeks, involving the following challenges:

- Coding Challenge:
	- Various LeetCode-style questions ranging from medium to hard were given, with extra points for each question given to the top few fastest participants.
- Linux Challenge:
	- Use Linux commands to find secrets inside the filesystem given.
- Find the Bug Challenge:
	- Given snippets of programming-language-agnostic code that each executed a certain kind of algorithm, find the bug in the code within the time limit.
- Quizzes:
	- Quizzes testing our general knowledge about programming and Meta.
- Product Thinking Challenge:
	- The product thinking challenge involved two stages that could be completed in a group. I completed the challenge in a two-man team. The first stage involved coming up with a 2 slide proposal for a tech idea that could solve a given problem statement, and the second stage involved fleshing out the details of our solution. My team was the overall champion for this challenge.
