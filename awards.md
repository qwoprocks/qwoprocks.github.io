# October 2022: Meta Global Hackathon

## 1st Place

The hackathon took place over 2 weeks, involving the following challenges:

- Coding Challenge:
	- Various LeetCode-style questions with difficulties ranging from medium to hard were given, with extra points for each question given to the top few fastest participants.
- Linux Challenge:
	- Use Linux commands to find secrets inside the filesystem given.
- Find the Bug Challenge:
	- Given snippets of programming-language-agnostic code that each executed a certain kind of algorithm, find the bug in the code within the time limit.
- Quizzes:
	- Quizzes testing general knowledge about programming and Meta.
- Product Thinking Challenge:
	- The product thinking challenge involved two stages that could be completed in groups of up to 4 people. I completed the challenge in a 2-man team. The first stage involved coming up with a 2-slide proposal for a tech idea that could solve a given problem statement, and the second stage involved fleshing out the details of our solution, with the best presentation chosen by a panel of Meta judges. My team was the overall champion for this challenge.

## Silver Award

My project was about the classification of handwritten characters by applying feature extraction on images and subsequently feeding these features into a small and simple feedforward neural network for classification. The feature extraction involved the following steps:
- Binarization of the image via Otsu's method
- Skeletonization
- Removing all connected components that were too small based on a threshold
- Extracting a fixed sample of points by tracing the remaining skeletons in a fixed order

This preprocessing helped my model achieve comparable results to the state of the art (at that point in time). I presented my methodology and results to 3 judges at the Engineering Fair in the form of a poster, and received the Silver Award for my efforts.
