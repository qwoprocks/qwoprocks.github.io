# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ming Chong

I'm a final year Computer Science undergraduate, specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI). 

While AI is my main focus, I have a broad range of interests spanning across multiple computing disciplines, and in general, I enjoy solving challenging problems and devising elegant solutions to them.

I'm passionate about both learning and teaching. I served as a teaching assistant for various modules over 6 semesters (3 years) at both [NUS](experience.html#teaching-assistant-1) and [CMU](experience.html#teaching-assistant-2).
